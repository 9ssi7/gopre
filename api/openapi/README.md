# OpenAPI Specification

This directory contains the OpenAPI specification (formerly known as Swagger) for the application's RESTful APIs. OpenAPI is a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection.

## Overview

The OpenAPI specification provides several benefits:

* **API Documentation:** It serves as a comprehensive and interactive documentation for the API, detailing available endpoints, request/response formats, authentication methods, and error codes.
* **Client Code Generation:** OpenAPI tools can generate client code in various programming languages, making it easier for developers to integrate with the API.
* **Server Code Generation:** Some tools can even generate server stubs from the OpenAPI specification, providing a starting point for API implementation.
* **Testing and Validation:** OpenAPI specifications can be used to validate API requests and responses, ensuring compliance with the defined contract.

## Structure

The OpenAPI specification is typically defined in a YAML or JSON file. The file structure follows the OpenAPI Specification version 3.0 (or later). The main components of the specification include:

* **Info:** Provides metadata about the API, such as title, description, version, and contact information.
* **Servers:** Defines the base URLs for the API endpoints.
* **Paths:** Describes the available endpoints (`/users`, `/orders`, etc.), the HTTP methods they support (`GET`, `POST`, etc.), and the input/output parameters for each operation.
* **Components:** Defines reusable schemas for request and response bodies, as well as security schemes (e.g., API keys, OAuth).

## Usage

The OpenAPI specification can be used in various ways:

* **Documentation:** Use tools like Swagger UI or Redoc to generate interactive API documentation from the specification.
* **Client Code Generation:** Use tools like OpenAPI Generator to generate client libraries in your preferred language (e.g., Go, JavaScript, Python).
* **Server Code Generation:** Some tools (like Swagger Codegen) can generate server stubs based on the OpenAPI specification.
* **Testing and Validation:** Integrate with tools like Dredd or Postman to validate your API implementation against the specification.

## CQRS Considerations

If the application follows the CQRS pattern, the OpenAPI specification should clearly distinguish between command and query endpoints. This can be achieved by:

* **Using different tags:** Tag command endpoints with `command` and query endpoints with `query`.
* **Using different paths:** Organize command and query endpoints under different paths (e.g., `/api/commands/...` and `/api/queries/...`).
* **Using different descriptions:** Clearly describe the purpose of each endpoint (command vs. query) in the operation descriptions.

## Example

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: My CQRS API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /api/commands/orders:
    post:
      tags:
        - command
      summary: Create a new order
      # ... (request/response schemas, etc.)
  /api/queries/orders:
    get:
      tags:
        - query
      summary: Get a list of orders
      # ... (request/response schemas, etc.)
```
