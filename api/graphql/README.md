# GraphQL API

This directory contains the implementation of the GraphQL API for the application. The GraphQL API provides a flexible and efficient way for clients to request exactly the data they need from the application.

## Overview

The GraphQL API is built using the [gqlgen](https://gqlgen.com/) library, a popular framework for creating GraphQL servers in Go. Gqlgen offers features like:

* **Schema-first development:** Define your GraphQL schema using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL), and gqlgen will generate the corresponding Go code.
* **Resolver binding:** Easily map GraphQL operations to Go functions (resolvers) that fetch and manipulate data.
* **Automatic type safety:** Gqlgen ensures type safety between your schema and resolvers, reducing the risk of runtime errors.
* **Performance optimizations:** Gqlgen includes features like dataloader for optimizing data fetching and reducing the number of database queries.

## Structure

The GraphQL API code is organized into the following files:

* **`schema.graphqls`:** Defines the GraphQL schema using the SDL. This file describes the types, queries, mutations, and subscriptions available in the API.
* **`generated.go`:** This file is automatically generated by gqlgen based on the schema definition. It contains Go types and interfaces that correspond to the schema elements.
* **`resolver.go`:** Contains the resolver functions that implement the logic for fetching and manipulating data in response to GraphQL queries and mutations.
* **`models.go`:** (Optional) Defines Go structs that represent the data models used by the GraphQL API.

## Usage

To use the GraphQL API, send GraphQL queries or mutations to the API endpoint using a tool like [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql), Altair [geçersiz URL kaldırıldı], or a custom client. The API will respond with JSON-formatted data that matches the structure of your request.

## CQRS Considerations

If the application follows the CQRS pattern, the GraphQL API should be designed to interact with both the command and query sides of the application. This means:

* **Commands (Mutations):** GraphQL mutations that modify the application state (e.g., creating, updating, or deleting resources) should be handled by the command service.
* **Queries:** GraphQL queries that retrieve data from the application should be handled by the query service.

Gqlgen makes it easy to separate the implementation of mutations and queries by using different resolver functions for each.

## Error Handling

The GraphQL API uses the standard GraphQL error format to indicate errors during query or mutation execution. Error responses will include a list of errors with messages and optional location information.

## Further Information

For more detailed information on how to use the GraphQL API, refer to the API documentation (if available) or the source code. You can also consult the gqlgen documentation for more information on how to build and customize GraphQL servers in Go.
