# Command-Line Interface (CLI)

This directory contains the implementation of the command-line interface (CLI) for the application. The CLI provides a way to interact with the application's core functionality directly from the terminal or command prompt.

## Overview

The CLI is built using the [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) library, a powerful framework for creating modern CLI applications in Go. Cobra provides features like:

* **Easy command definition:** Define commands and subcommands with a simple structure.
* **Automatic help generation:** Generate helpful usage information for users.
* **Flags and arguments:** Easily handle command-line flags and arguments.
* **Nested commands:** Organize commands into a hierarchical structure for better usability.

## Structure

The CLI code is organized into the following files:

* **`root.go`:** Defines the root command of the CLI, which serves as the entry point for the application.
* **`commands/`:** This directory contains individual command files, each defining a specific command or subcommand.
* **`flags/`:** (Optional) This directory can be used to store common flag definitions that can be reused across multiple commands.

## Usage

To use the CLI, run the compiled executable from your terminal. The root command will display the available commands and their usage information.

```bash
# Run the CLI executable
./your-app-cli

# Get help for a specific command
./your-app-cli <command> --help
```

## CQRS Considerations

If the application follows the CQRS pattern, the CLI should be designed to interact with both the command and query sides of the application. This means:

* **Commands:** The CLI should provide commands to trigger actions that modify the application state (e.g., creating, updating, or deleting resources). These commands should typically interact with the command service.
* **Queries:** The CLI should provide commands to retrieve data from the application (e.g., listing resources or getting details of a specific resource). These commands should typically interact with the query service.

The specific implementation details of how the CLI interacts with the command and query services will depend on the chosen communication mechanisms (e.g., gRPC, HTTP).

## Examples

Here are some examples of how the CLI might be used:

```bash
# Create a new order
./your-app-cli order create --customer-id 123 --items "product1,2;product2,1"

# List all orders for a customer
./your-app-cli order list --customer-id 123

# Get details of a specific order
./your-app-cli order get --order-id 456
```
