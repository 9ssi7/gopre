# gRPC API

This directory contains the definition of the gRPC API for the application. gRPC is a high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework that uses Protocol Buffers (protobuf) as the interface definition language (IDL) for describing service contracts and payload messages.

## Overview

gRPC provides several advantages over traditional REST APIs:

* **Performance:** gRPC uses binary serialization and HTTP/2 for efficient communication, making it faster than text-based formats like JSON.
* **Type safety:** Protocol Buffers provide strong typing for messages, reducing the risk of errors due to mismatched data types.
* **Code generation:** gRPC tools can generate client and server code in various languages, simplifying development and ensuring consistency.
* **Streaming:** gRPC supports both client-side and server-side streaming, enabling efficient communication for real-time applications.

## Structure

The gRPC API code is organized into the following files:

* **`*.proto` files:** These files define the service contracts, message types, and RPC methods using the Protocol Buffers language. Each file typically represents a specific service or a related set of messages.
* **`*_grpc.pb.go` files:** These files are generated by the `protoc` compiler and contain the Go code for the gRPC client and server stubs, as well as the message structures.

## Usage

To use the gRPC API, you'll need to:

1. **Generate the Go code:** Use the `protoc` compiler with the Go gRPC plugin to generate the Go code from the `.proto` files.
2. **Implement the server:** Write the server-side code that implements the service methods defined in the `.proto` files.
3. **Create a client:** Write the client-side code that uses the generated stubs to call the RPC methods on the server.

## CQRS Considerations

If the application follows the CQRS pattern, the gRPC API should be designed to interact with both the command and query sides of the application. This means:

* **Commands:** gRPC methods that modify the application state (e.g., creating, updating, or deleting resources) should be defined in a `CommandService` and handled by the command service.
* **Queries:** gRPC methods that retrieve data from the application should be defined in a `QueryService` and handled by the query service.

## Example

```protobuf
// api/proto/order_service.proto
syntax = "proto3";

package order;

service OrderService {
  rpc PlaceOrder (PlaceOrderRequest) returns (PlaceOrderResponse) {}
  rpc GetOrder (GetOrderRequest) returns (GetOrderResponse) {}
}

message PlaceOrderRequest {
  // ...
}

message PlaceOrderResponse {
  // ...
}

message GetOrderRequest {
  // ...
}

message GetOrderResponse {
  // ...
}
```
