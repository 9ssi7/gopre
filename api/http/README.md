# HTTP API

This directory contains the implementation of the HTTP API for the application. The HTTP API provides a RESTful interface for clients to interact with the application over the HTTP protocol.

## Overview

The HTTP API is built using the [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) web framework, a popular choice for building high-performance REST APIs in Go. Gin offers features like:

* **Fast routing:** Efficient handling of HTTP requests based on URL paths and methods.
* **Middleware support:** Easily integrate middleware for authentication, authorization, logging, and other cross-cutting concerns.
* **Data binding:** Automatically bind request data to Go structs for easier processing.
* **JSON rendering:** Conveniently render responses in JSON format.

## Structure

The HTTP API code is organized into the following files:

* **`handlers.go`:** Contains the handler functions that process incoming HTTP requests and generate responses.
* **`routes.go`:** Defines the routing configuration, mapping URL paths and methods to specific handler functions.
* **`middleware.go`:** (Optional) Contains middleware functions for authentication, authorization, etc.
* **`models.go`:** (Optional) Defines request and response models (data structures) for the API.

## Usage

To use the HTTP API, send requests to the appropriate endpoints using a tool like `curl`, `Postman`, or a web browser. The API will respond with JSON-formatted data.

```bash
# Example: Get a list of products
curl http://localhost:8080/api/products
```

## CQRS Considerations

If the application follows the CQRS pattern, the HTTP API should be designed to interact with both the command and query sides of the application. This means:

* **Commands:** HTTP requests that modify the application state (e.g., creating, updating, or deleting resources) should be handled by the command service. Typically, these requests would use `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE` methods and be routed to endpoints like `/api/commands/...`.
* **Queries:** HTTP requests that retrieve data from the application (e.g., listing resources or getting details of a specific resource) should be handled by the query service. Typically, these requests would use the `GET` method and be routed to endpoints like `/api/queries/...`.

The specific implementation details of how the HTTP API interacts with the command and query services will depend on the chosen communication mechanisms (e.g., gRPC, direct database access).

## Error Handling

The HTTP API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests. Error responses will typically include a JSON payload with additional details about the error.

## Further Information

For more detailed information on how to use the HTTP API, refer to the API documentation (if available) or the source code. You can also consult the Gin documentation for more information on how to build and customize REST APIs in Go.s
