# Command (cmd) Layer

This directory contains the main entry points for the application's services. The specific structure of this directory depends on whether the application uses the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern or not.

## CQRS Implementation

If the application adopts CQRS, this directory will have the following structure:

* **`cmdsrv/`:**
    * **`main.go`:** Contains the main function for the command service, responsible for handling commands that modify the application state.
    * **`Dockerfile`:** (If using Docker) Defines the Docker image for the command service.
* **`querysrv/`:**
    * **`main.go`:** Contains the main function for the query service, responsible for handling queries that retrieve data from the application.
    * **`Dockerfile`:** (If using Docker) Defines the Docker image for the query service.

In this scenario, the command and query services are separate processes, each with its own entry point and potentially its own deployment configuration.

## Non-CQRS Implementation

If the application does not use CQRS, this directory will have a simpler structure:

* **`myapp/`:**
    * **`main.go`:** Contains the main function for the entire application, handling both commands and queries.
    * **`Dockerfile`:** (If using Docker) Defines the Docker image for the application.

In this case, there is only one entry point for the application, and both commands and queries are handled within the same process.

## Responsibilities

Regardless of whether CQRS is used, the `cmd` layer is responsible for:

* **Initializing the application:** Setting up database connections, configuring dependencies, and starting any necessary background processes.
* **Starting the servers:** Launching the HTTP, GraphQL, or gRPC servers to listen for incoming requests.
* **Routing requests:** Directing incoming requests to the appropriate handlers in the `api` or `internal/application` layers.
* **Error handling:** Handling errors that occur during request processing or server operation.

## Deployment

The `cmd` layer also plays a crucial role in the deployment of the application. The Dockerfiles (if present) define how the application is packaged into Docker images, which can then be deployed to various environments.

## Further Information

For more detailed information on the specific implementation of the command and query services (or the combined application), refer to the `main.go` files within the respective subdirectories.
