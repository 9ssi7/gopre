# Entities

This directory contains the **entities** that represent the core concepts and building blocks of your application's domain model. In Go, entities are typically represented as structs with methods that encapsulate their behavior.

## Overview

In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), entities are the primary means of modeling the real-world objects and concepts that your application deals with. They encapsulate data and behavior related to a specific entity, ensuring that the domain logic is cohesive and well-organized.

## Characteristics of Entities

* **Identity:** Each entity has a unique identifier (e.g., an ID or a UUID) that distinguishes it from other entities of the same type. In Go, this is often represented as a field within the struct.
* **Mutable State:** Entities can have attributes that can be modified over time. In Go, these attributes are represented as fields within the struct.
* **Behavior:** Entities often have methods that encapsulate the business logic related to their specific domain. In Go, these methods are defined as functions that operate on the entity's struct.
* **Relationships:** Entities can have relationships with other entities (e.g., a `Customer` entity can have multiple `Order` entities). In Go, these relationships can be represented using struct fields that reference other entities.

## Examples

Here are some examples of entities you might find in a typical e-commerce application, implemented in Go:

```go
// Product entity
type Product struct {
    ID          string    `gorm:"primaryKey"`
    Name        string    `gorm:"not null"`
    Description string
    Price       float64   `gorm:"not null"`
    CreatedAt   time.Time `gorm:"autoCreateTime"`
    UpdatedAt   time.Time `gorm:"autoUpdateTime"`
}

// Customer entity
type Customer struct {
    ID        string `gorm:"primaryKey"`
    Name      string `gorm:"not null"`
    Email     string `gorm:"unique;not null"`
    // ... other fields
}

// Order entity
type Order struct {
    ID         string `gorm:"primaryKey"`
    CustomerID string `gorm:"not null"`
    Status     string `gorm:"not null"`
    // ... other fields
}
```

## Guidelines for Defining Entities

* **Focus on the domain:** Entities should represent concepts that are meaningful in the business domain, not technical implementation details.
* **Keep entities small and focused:** Each entity should have a clear and well-defined responsibility within the domain.
* **Use value objects for attributes:** When an attribute has no conceptual identity of its own (e.g., an address or a money amount), use a value object to represent it.
* **Model relationships between entities:** Use struct fields that reference other entities to represent relationships.
* **Encapsulate business logic:** Define methods on the entity structs to encapsulate the business logic related to their specific domain.

## CQRS Considerations

In a CQRS architecture, entities are primarily used on the command side of the application. They are responsible for processing commands and ensuring that the domain rules are enforced. The query side of the application typically uses a different data model optimized for reading, which may not directly map to the entities used on the command side.
