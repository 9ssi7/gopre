# Domain Events

This directory contains the **domain events** that represent significant occurrences within the application's business domain. Domain events are an essential part of Domain-Driven Design (DDD), especially in Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) architectures.

## Overview

Domain events capture the fact that something important has happened within the domain. They are not technical events (like database updates), but rather business-related events that have meaning within the context of the domain.

## Characteristics of Domain Events

* **Business Significance:** Domain events represent actions or state changes that are relevant to the business domain.
* **Immutability:** Domain events are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once they have occurred.
* **Named in the Past Tense:** Domain events are typically named in the past tense to reflect that they represent something that has already happened (e.g., `OrderPlaced`, `PaymentProcessed`, `InventoryUpdated`).
* **Payload:** Domain events often carry a payload of data that provides context about the event.

## Go Implementation

In Go, domain events are often represented as structs. The struct fields typically include the event name, a timestamp, and any relevant data associated with the event.

## Example

```go
// domain/events/order_placed.go
package events

import "time"

type OrderPlaced struct {
    OrderID     string
    CustomerID  string
    TotalAmount float64
    OccurredAt  time.Time
}
```

## Domain Events in CQRS

In CQRS architectures, domain events play a crucial role in synchronizing data between the command and query sides of the application. When a command is processed on the command side, it results in the emission of one or more domain events. These events are then consumed by the query side to update its own data model, ensuring that the query side eventually reflects the changes made on the command side.

## Eventual Consistency

In separated CQRS architectures, where the command and query sides have their own databases, the data synchronization process is asynchronous. This means that there might be a slight delay between when a command is executed and when the corresponding changes are reflected in the query model. This is known as eventual consistency.

## Data Synchronization Challenges in CQRS

* **Event Ordering:** Ensuring that events are processed in the correct order on the query side is essential to maintain data consistency.
* **Event Duplication:** The query side must be able to handle duplicate events gracefully, as they may be delivered multiple times due to network issues or retries.
* **Event Versioning:** If the structure of domain events changes over time, the query side must be able to handle events of different versions.

## Solutions for Data Synchronization

* **Message Brokers:** Use a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) to reliably deliver events from the command side to the query side. Message brokers provide features like guaranteed delivery, ordering, and deduplication.
* **Event Sourcing:** Store all domain events in an event store. This allows the query side to rebuild its state by replaying the events in order.
* **Event Versioning Strategies:** Implement strategies to handle different versions of events, such as upcasting (converting older events to newer versions) or maintaining multiple handlers for different event versions.
