# Domain Layer

This directory is the heart of the application, encapsulating the core business logic and knowledge. It is the foundation of the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach, where the software model aligns closely with the real-world business domain.

## Overview

The `domain` layer is responsible for defining the language and rules of the business. It is independent of any specific technology or infrastructure concerns, focusing solely on the problem domain itself. This isolation ensures that the business logic remains pure and unaffected by external changes.

## Subfolders

### `aggregates`

This subfolder contains the aggregate root entities, which are the primary building blocks of the domain model.

* **Aggregate Roots:** An aggregate is a cluster of associated objects that are treated as a single unit for data changes. The aggregate root is the only entity in an aggregate that can be referenced directly from outside the aggregate.
* **Consistency Boundaries:** Aggregates help maintain data consistency by enforcing invariants and business rules within their boundaries.
* **Example:** In an e-commerce application, an `Order` aggregate could include `OrderItem` entities, `ShippingAddress`, and `BillingAddress` value objects.

### `entities`

This subfolder contains individual entities that represent core concepts within the domain.

* **Entities:** Entities have a unique identity that persists over time, even if their attributes change. They are distinguished by their identity rather than their attributes.
* **Example:** In an e-commerce application, a `Product` or a `Customer` would be considered entities.

### `valueobjects`

This subfolder contains value objects, which are immutable and represent a descriptive aspect of the domain.

* **Value Objects:** Value objects are defined by their attributes and have no conceptual identity. They are compared by value, not by reference.
* **Example:** In an e-commerce application, an `Address`, `Money`, or `Quantity` would be considered value objects.

### `events`

This subfolder (especially relevant in CQRS) contains domain events that signify important occurrences within the domain.

* **Domain Events:** Domain events are raised when something significant happens within the domain. They are used to communicate changes between different parts of the application, especially in CQRS architectures.
* **Example:** In an e-commerce application, events like `OrderPlaced`, `OrderShipped`, or `PaymentFailed` would be domain events.

## CQRS and the Domain Layer

In a CQRS architecture, the domain layer plays a central role. Commands are processed by the domain model, resulting in state changes and the emission of domain events. These events are then used to update the query model, ensuring eventual consistency between the two models.

## Event Synchronization in CQRS

In a CQRS setup with separate databases for commands and queries, event synchronization is crucial. Domain events emitted by the command side are typically published to a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka). The query side subscribes to these events and updates its own data model accordingly. This ensures that the query model eventually reflects the changes made on the command side.
