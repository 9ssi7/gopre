# Application Layer

This layer houses the core logic for processing commands and queries in your application, acting as a bridge between the API layer (which receives external requests) and the domain layer (which encapsulates business rules and data).

## Subfolders

### `commands`

This subfolder contains command handlers, each responsible for processing a specific type of command. Commands represent actions that modify the state of the application (e.g., creating a new order, updating a user profile, or canceling a subscription).

**Key Responsibilities:**

* **Validating input:** Ensure that the command data is valid according to the business rules.
* **Executing business logic:** Apply the necessary business logic to the domain model, potentially resulting in changes to aggregates and entities.
* **Persisting changes:** Use repositories to save the updated state of the domain objects to the database.
* **Emitting events:** (If using CQRS) Publish domain events to notify other parts of the system about the changes that occurred.

### `queries`

This subfolder contains query handlers, each responsible for processing a specific type of query. Queries represent requests for data from the application (e.g., fetching a list of orders, getting the details of a specific product, or searching for users).

**Key Responsibilities:**

* **Validating input:** Ensure that the query parameters are valid.
* **Fetching data:** Retrieve the necessary data from the domain model, potentially using repositories.
* **Formatting response:** Prepare the data in a suitable format for the API layer to return to the client.

## CQRS Considerations

In a CQRS architecture, the `application` layer plays a crucial role in separating the command and query paths. Command handlers interact with the domain model to process commands and emit events, while query handlers typically use a separate data model (potentially a different database) optimized for reading to efficiently serve queries.

## Example (Command Handler)

```go
// application/commands/place_order.go
package commands

type PlaceOrderHandler struct {
    orderRepository repositories.OrderRepository
    eventBus        eventbus.EventBus
}

func (h *PlaceOrderHandler) Handle(cmd PlaceOrder) error {
    // Validate input
    // ...

    // Create order aggregate
    order := aggregates.NewOrder(cmd.CustomerID, cmd.OrderItems, cmd.ShippingInfo, cmd.BillingInfo)

    // Save order to repository
    if err := h.orderRepository.Save(order); err != nil {
        return err
    }

    // Publish order placed event
    h.eventBus.Publish(events.OrderPlaced{OrderID: order.ID})

    return nil
}
```

## Example (Query Handler)

```go
// application/queries/get_order.go
package queries

type GetOrderHandler struct {
    orderRepository repositories.OrderRepository
}

func (h *GetOrderHandler) Handle(query GetOrder) (*aggregates.Order, error) {
    // Validate input
    // ...

    // Fetch order from repository
    order, err := h.orderRepository.GetByID(query.OrderID)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    return order, nil
}
```

These examples demonstrate how command and query handlers interact with the domain layer and repositories to fulfill their respective responsibilities. The separation of concerns between commands and queries leads to a more maintainable and scalable application architecture.

### services

This subfolder contains application services that encapsulate more complex business logic or operations that don't fit neatly into the command or query handlers. Application services often coordinate multiple domain objects or repositories to fulfill a specific use case.

**Key Responsibilities:**

* **Orchestrating complex workflows:** Implement business processes that involve multiple steps or interactions between different domain objects.
* **Encapsulating business rules:** Centralize business logic that doesn't belong to a specific aggregate or entity.
* **Coordinating external dependencies:** Interact with external systems (e.g., payment gateways, email providers) as needed to complete a business operation.
Example (Application Service):

```go
// application/services/payment_service.go
package services

type PaymentService struct {
    paymentGateway paymentgateway.PaymentGateway
}

func (s *PaymentService) ProcessPayment(orderID string, amount float64) error {
    // Validate input
    // ...

    // Charge the customer's payment method
    err := s.paymentGateway.Charge(orderID, amount)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }

    // Update order status (if successful)
    // ...

    return nil
}
```

In this example, the PaymentService orchestrates the process of charging a customer's payment method and updating the order status accordingly. It encapsulates the interaction with the external payment gateway and the business logic related to payment processing.

### Summary

The application layer, with its commands, queries, and services subfolders, provides a structured way to organize the application logic in a CQRS architecture. By separating concerns and responsibilities, it promotes maintainability, testability, and scalability of the application.
