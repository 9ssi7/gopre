# Infrastructure Layer

This directory contains the implementation details for interacting with external systems and resources that the application depends on. It acts as the bridge between the domain layer (which defines the business logic) and the external world.

## Overview

The `infrastructure` layer is responsible for providing the necessary adapters and implementations to connect the application with various external components, such as databases, message queues, external APIs, and configuration sources. This layer ensures that the domain layer remains independent of specific technologies and can easily adapt to changes in the infrastructure.

## Subfolders

### `messaging`

(If using CQRS) This subfolder contains the implementation of the messaging infrastructure used to publish and consume domain events. It typically includes:

* **Message publisher:** A component responsible for sending domain events to a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka).
* **Message consumer:** A component responsible for receiving domain events from the message broker and dispatching them to the appropriate event handlers.
* **Error handling and retries:** Mechanisms to handle errors during message publishing or consumption and to retry failed operations.

### `repos`

This subfolder contains the implementations of the repositories that provide access to the underlying data storage for the domain objects. Repositories abstract away the details of the specific data storage technology (e.g., SQL database, NoSQL database, file system) and provide a consistent interface for the domain layer to interact with the data.

### `db/seeds`

(Optional) This subfolder contains data seeding scripts that can be used to populate the database with initial data for development or testing purposes.

### `db/migrations`

(Optional) This subfolder contains database migration scripts that are used to manage the evolution of the database schema over time. Migrations allow you to incrementally update the database schema in a controlled and reversible way.

## Database Interaction

This project utilizes GORM as the ORM for database interactions. The `database` subfolder within `infra` may contain:

* **`db/pg.go`:**  Handles the database connection setup and configuration using GORM.

## CQRS Considerations

In a CQRS architecture, the `infrastructure` layer is responsible for implementing the communication between the command and query sides of the application. This typically involves using a message broker to publish and consume domain events.

## Further Information

For more detailed information on the specific implementations within the `infrastructure` layer, refer to the source code and README files within the respective subfolders. You can also consult the documentation for the specific technologies used (e.g., GORM, RabbitMQ, Kafka) for further guidance.
